Steps

## Part 1

1. Setup git repo
2. create an environment and activate it
3. create the readme
4. create the gitignore
5. create the requiremnts.txt with "-e ."
6. create the setup.py file. This file has the project information and also function to install all the packages mentioned in requirements.txt.
7. create a src folder with __init__.py. We want to have this as a package and for that we have the __init__.py file. 
    wherever we have this file it will be considered as a package and will be build. Then we can import it.
8. pip install - r requiremnts.txt, with this the packages should be installed and then .egg-info will be created.

## Part 2  (project structure)

1. Create a components folder inside src with the following files:
    - __init__.py
    - data_ingestion.py
    - data_transformation.py
    - model_trainer.py

2. Create a pipeline folder inside src with the following files:
    - __init__.py
    - train_pipeline.py
    - predict_pipeline.py

3. create the following files inside the src folder
    - exception.py
    - logger.py
    - utils.py


## Part 3

Choosing the problem statement and the dataset. Then we do the following to understand the dataset in a better way.

Creted a folder named notebook:
 - with the folder created a data folder with the dataset
 - another file called EDA_student_perfomance (Exploratory data analysis) with the insights of the dataset
 - another file called model_training

    - Understanding the Problem Statement
    - Data Collection
    - Data Checks to perform
    - Exploratory data analysis
    - Data Pre-Processing
    - Model Training
    - Choose best model
