4. create the gitignore
5. create the requiremnts.txt with "-e ."
6. create the setup.py file
7. create a src folder with __init__.py. We want to have this as a package and for that we have the __init__.py file. 
    wherever we have this file it will be considered as a package and will be build. Then we can import it.
8. pip install - r requiremnts.txt, with this the packages should be installed and then .egg-info will be created.
